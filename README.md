# Rust Practice Problems (Rusting)

Welcome to the **Rust Practice Problems** repository! This repository contains a collection of coding challenges and exercises designed to help you improve your Rust programming skills. Each problem comes with a detailed solution, complete with thorough explanations and comments to help you understand the underlying concepts.

## üìö Overview

The practice problems in this repository cover a variety of topics, ranging from basic Rust syntax and control structures to more advanced topics like iterators, functional programming, and data structures such as `HashMap` and `HashSet`. Whether you're a beginner looking to get started with Rust or an experienced developer seeking to deepen your understanding of the language, this repository offers something for everyone.

## üõ†Ô∏è Intent

The primary intent of this repository is to:

1. **Enhance Understanding**: Provide clear, well-commented examples that illustrate key Rust concepts and idiomatic usage.
2. **Promote Best Practices**: Demonstrate how to write clean, efficient, and idiomatic Rust code.
3. **Encourage Learning by Doing**: Offer hands-on exercises that encourage you to think critically and solve problems using Rust.
4. **Support Functional Programming**: Highlight Rust's powerful iterator methods and functional programming capabilities through practical examples.
5. **Prepare for Interviews**: Help developers prepare for coding interviews by practicing common algorithmic problems in Rust.

## üìÇ Structure

Each problem is organized into its own directory, containing:

- **Problem Statement**: A description of the problem, including input/output examples and constraints.
- **Solution**: The Rust implementation of the solution, with detailed comments explaining each step.
- **Discussion**: A brief discussion of the solution, highlighting key Rust features and best practices used.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with the practice problems:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rust-practice-problems.git
    cd rust-practice-problems
    ```

2. **Explore the Problems**: Navigate through the directories to explore different problems and their solutions.

3. **Run the Code**:
    - Ensure you have Rust installed on your machine. If not, you can install it using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
    - Use `cargo run` or `rustc` to compile and run the code for each problem.

    Example:
    ```bash
    cd problem_directory
    cargo run
    ```

## üåü Featured Problems

- **Group Anagrams**: Group strings that are anagrams of each other using a `HashMap` and sorted keys.
- **Intersection of Two Arrays**: Find the intersection of two arrays, ensuring each element is unique, using `HashSet`.
- **Two Sum**: Find the indices of two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target using a `HashMap`.
- **First Unique Character**: Identify the first non-repeating character in a string using a `HashMap`.

## üìñ Learning Resources

In addition to the practice problems, here are some valuable resources for learning Rust:

- [The Rust Programming Language (The Book)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)
- [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings): Small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code.

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a new problem you'd like to add, or if you want to improve the existing solutions, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. Please make sure your code is well-commented and follows Rust's idiomatic practices.
